# File-Hider
File Hider is a small program made entirely in batch. It allows you to hide a file so much that it requires the Command Prompt itself to find and/or show the file 

To use simply place the batch file in the same directory as the file/folder you want hidden/un-hidden then start the program and do what it tells you
